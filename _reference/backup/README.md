## 📚 Integration with Main Documentation

### How This Relates to `/docs/`

| Backup Content | Main Docs Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Implementation summaries | `/docs/technical/implementation/` | Current feature implementations |
| Task completions | `/docs/technical/TASKS_10.1_10.2_CHECKLIST.md` | Current task tracking |
| Reports | `/docs/reference/reports/` | Compliance and audit reports |
| Analysis files | `/docs/reference/` | Supporting analysis |

### Moving Content Between Backup and Main Docs

If you need to **promote** content from backup to main documentation:

1. **Review content** in `_reference/backup/`
2. **Update** with current information if needed
3. **Move to appropriate location** in `docs/`:
   - Implementation details → `docs/technical/implementation/`
   - Summaries → `docs/technical/` or `docs/guides/`
   - Reports → `docs/reference/reports/`
4. **Update INDEX.md** in `docs/` with new content
5. **Archive superseded** files back to `_reference/backup/archives/`

## 🔄 Maintenance Guidelines

### When to Add Files Here

✅ Historical reports (task completions, validation results)  
✅ Superseded analysis documents  
✅ Implementation details from completed features  
✅ Legacy backup versions  

### When to Move Files to `/docs/`

→ Content needed for current development  
→ Standards and guidelines still in use  
→ Reference materials for active systems  
→ Compliance and audit documentation  

### When to Delete Files

❌ Only with explicit approval  
❌ Document reason in git commit  
❌ Verify no other references exist  
❌ Consider archiving to external backup first
